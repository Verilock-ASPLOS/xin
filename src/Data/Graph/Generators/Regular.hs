{-|
    Generate a completely connected graph with n nodes.

    The generated graph contains node labels [0..n-1]

    In contrast to 'completeGraphWithSelfloops' this function
    does not generate self-loops.

    Contains only one edge between two connected nodes,
    use 'Data.Graph.Inductive.Basic.undir' to make it
    quasi-undirected. The generated edge (i,j) satisfied @i < j@.

    Variant of 'completeGraph' generating self-loops.

    All generated edges (i,j) satisfy @i <= j@.

    See 'completeGraph' for a more detailed behaviour description.

{-|
    Generate the complete bipartite graph with n1 nodes in
    the first partition and n2 nodes in the second partition.

    Each node in the first partition is connected to each node
    in the second partition.

    The first partition nodes are identified by [0..n1-1]
    while the nodes in the second partition are identified
    by [n1..n1+n2-1]

    Use 'Data.Graph.Inductive.Basic.undir' to also add edges
    from the second partition to the first partition.

{-|
    Generate the barbell graph, consisting of two complete subgraphs
    connected by a single path.

    In contrast to 'generalizedBarbellGraph', this function always
    generates identically-sized bells. Therefore this is a special
    case of 'generalizedBarbellGraph'
