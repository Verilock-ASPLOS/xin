{-|
    The information required to build a graph.

    This data structure is designed to occupy minimal space.
    With n being the number of nodes, the edge list contains
    tuples (from, to), denoting an edge from node *from* to node
    *to* where *from* and *to* are integers less than the number
    of nodes.

    Note that for a graph with n nodes, the nodes are labelled
    @[0..n-1]@.

    This data structure is library-agnostic and can be converted
    to arbitrary representations.
